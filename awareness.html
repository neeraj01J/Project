   Healthy eating and nutrition are pivotal in maintaining overall well-being and preventing chronic diseases.

This shift has significant implications for public health, particularly as the nation grapples with rising obesity rates, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Understanding the causes and effects of dietary choices, alongside a focus on nutritious foods, can help promote better health outcomes.
